      My first and biggest passion outside of computers is photography. It all started when I found an old digital camera that my parents had received as a wedding gift but never used, while I was visiting my family in Ukraine a few years ago. From the moment I held it, it never left my hands or my mind — and it’s still with me to this day. Even though I use a different camera now, that first one will always be special to me because it marked the beginning of my favorite hobby. I love taking photos with all my heart — it doesn’t matter what of. Its possible to find beauty even in the smallest things: in the people close to me, in life, in nature, in the sky and stars. To me, photography feels a lot like love. At this point it just got so deeply in my bones that i dont think my interest will ever fade.

      Another passion of mine, though not the least beloved, is drawing. It all started when I was very young and has stayed with me ever since. As a kid, i used to draw things non-stop, and ask my mum to buy me more of various colors, paints. Also, I have experience with drawing in lots of different styles, my favourite is the common black-white one. I don’t have to draw every single day but when I do, I feel completely at peace and can spend lots and lots of hours doing it. I especially love drawing people — people I care about. If there’s a sixth language of love, this would be mine. That’s why I want to combine it with my programming knowledge and work in an industry that lets me express both sides of who I am. Beauty and creativity are able to be digital too.
